          Azure Container Registry
          If you use Azure Container Registry (ACR) as your container image store, you need to grant
          permissions to the service principal for your AKS cluster to read and pull images. Currently,
          the recommended configuration is to use the az aks create or az aks update command to
          integrate with a registry and assign the appropriate role for the service principal. For
          detailed steps, see Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes
          Service.
          To avoid needing an Owner or Azure account administrator role, you can configure a
          service principal manually or use an existing service principal to authenticate ACR from
          AKS. For more information, see ACR authentication with service principals or Authenticate
          from Kubernetes with a pull secret.

          Azure Active Directory integration
          The security of AKS clusters can be enhanced with the integration of Azure Active Directory
          (AD). Built on decades of enterprise identity management, Azure AD is a multi-tenant,
          cloud-based directory, and identity management service that combines core directory
          services, application access management, and identity protection. With Azure AD, you can
          integrate on-premises identities into AKS clusters to provide a single source for account
          management and security.
          Azure Active Directory integration with AKS clusters
          With Azure AD-integrated AKS clusters, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes
          resources within a namespace or across the cluster. To obtain a kubectl configuration
          context, a user can run the az aks get-credentials command. When a user then interacts
          with the AKS cluster with kubectl, they're prompted to sign in with their Azure AD
          credentials. This approach provides a single source for user account management and
          password credentials. The user can only access the resources as defined by the cluster
          administrator.
          Azure AD authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect
          is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For more information on OpenID
          Connect, see the Open ID connect documentation. From inside of the Kubernetes cluster,
          Webhook Token Authentication is used to verify authentication tokens. Webhook token
          authentication is configured and managed as part of the AKS cluster.

        remediation: "By enabling private endpoint access to the Kubernetes API server, all communication
        between your nodes and the API server stays within your VPC. You can also limit the IP
        addresses that can access your API server from the internet, or completely disable
        internet access to the API server.
        With this in mind, you can update your cluster accordingly using the AKS CLI to ensure
        that Private Endpoint Access is enabled.
        If you choose to also enable Public Endpoint Access then you should also configure a
        list of allowable CIDR blocks, resulting in restricted access from the internet. If you
        specify no CIDR blocks, then the public API server endpoint is able to receive and
        process requests from all IP addresses by defaulting to ['0.0.0.0/0'].
        For example, the following command would enable private access to the Kubernetes
        API as well as limited public access over the internet from a single IP address (noting
        the /32 CIDR suffix"

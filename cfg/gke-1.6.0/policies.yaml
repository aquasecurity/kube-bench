          Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
          if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
          Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
          clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
          kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

          For each namespace in the cluster, review the rights assigned to the default service
          account and ensure that it has no roles or cluster roles bound to it apart from the
          defaults.
          Additionally ensure that the automountServiceAccountToken: false setting is in
          place for each default service account.

        remediation: |
          Seccomp is an alpha feature currently. By default, all alpha features are disabled. So, you
          would need to enable alpha features in the apiserver by passing "--feature-
          gates=AllAlpha=true" argument.
          Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS
          parameter to "--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          KUBE_API_ARGS="--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          Based on your system, restart the kube-apiserver service. For example:
          systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service
          Use annotations to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An
          example is as below:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Pod
          metadata:
            name: trustworthy-pod

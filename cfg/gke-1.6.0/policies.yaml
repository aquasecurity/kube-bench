        remediation: |
          Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
          if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
          Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
          clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
          kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

          Where possible, bind to non-default, user-defined groups with least-privilege roles.
          If there are any unsafe bindings to the user system:anonymous, proceed to delete them
          after consideration for cluster operations with only necessary, safer bindings.

        remediation: |
          Ensure that Pod Security Admission is in place for every namespace which contains
          user workloads. Run the following command to enforce the Baseline profile in a namespace:

          To use a CNI plugin with Network Policy, enable Network Policy in GKE, and the CNI plugin
          will be updated. See Recommendation 5.6.7.

        text: "Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to docker/default in your pod definitions (Automated)"
        remediation: |
          Seccomp is an alpha feature currently. By default, all alpha features are disabled. So, you
          would need to enable alpha features in the apiserver by passing "--feature-
          gates=AllAlpha=true" argument.
          Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS
          parameter to "--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          KUBE_API_ARGS="--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          Based on your system, restart the kube-apiserver service. For example:
          systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service
          Use annotations to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An
          example is as below:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Pod
          metadata:
            name: trustworthy-pod
            annotations:
              seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default

          Containers.

        remediation: |
          Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes
          resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.

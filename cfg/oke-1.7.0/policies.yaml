          Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges. Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
          
            kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

          Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of privileged containers.
          To enable PSA for a namespace in your cluster, set the pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce label with the policy value you want to enforce.

            kubectl label --overwrite ns NAMESPACE pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted

          The above command enforces the restricted policy for the NAMESPACE namespace. You can also enable Pod Security Admission for all your namespaces. For example:

            kubectl label --overwrite ns --all pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=baseline

          As with RBAC policies, network policies should adhere to the policy of least privileged access. Start by creating a deny all policy that restricts all inbound and outbound traffic from a namespace or create a global policy using Calico.

          Follow the documentation and create NetworkPolicy objects as you need them. Clusters you create with Container Engine for Kubernetes have flannel installed as the default CNI network provider. flannel is a simple overlay virtual network that satisfies the requirements of the Kubernetes networking model by attaching IP addresses to containers.
          Although flannel satisfies the requirements of the Kubernetes networking model, it does not support NetworkPolicy resources. If you want to enhance the security of clusters you create with Container Engine for Kubernetes by implementing network policies, you have to install and configure a network provider that does support NetworkPolicy resources. One such provider is Calico (refer to the Kubernetes documentation for a list of other network providers). Calico is an open source networking and network security solution for containers, virtual machines, and native host-based workloads.
          Use the Calico open-source software in conjunction with flannel. The Calico Enterprise does not support flannel.

          Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party secrets management solution.
          The master nodes in a Kubernetes cluster store sensitive configuration data (such asauthentication tokens, passwords, and SSH keys) as Kubernetes secret objects in etcd. Etcd is an open source distributed key-value store that Kubernetes uses for clustercoordination and state management. In the Kubernetes clusters created by Container Engine for Kubernetes, etcd writes and reads data to and from block storage volumes in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volume service. Although the data in block storage volumes is encrypted, Kubernetes secrets at rest in etcd itself are not encrypted by default.
          For additional security, when you create a new cluster you can specify that Kubernetes secrets at rest in etcd are to be encrypted using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault service.

          As a best practice we recommend that you scope the binding for privileged pods to service accounts within a particular namespace, e.g. kube-system, and limiting access to that namespace. For all other serviceaccounts/namespaces, we recommend implementing a more restrictive policy such as this:

            apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
            kind: PodSecurityPolicy
            metadata:
              name: restricted
            annotations:
              seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'docker/default,runtime/default'
              apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'runtime/default'
              seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: 'runtime/default'
              apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: 'runtime/default'
            spec:
              privileged: false
              # Required to prevent escalations to root.
              allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
              # This is redundant with non-root + disallow privilege escalation,
              # but we can provide it for defense in depth.
              requiredDropCapabilities:
              - ALL
              # Allow core volume types.
              volumes:
              - 'configMap'
              - 'emptyDir'
              - 'projected'
              - 'secret'
              - 'downwardAPI'
              # Assume that persistentVolumes set up by the cluster admin are safe to use.
              - 'persistentVolumeClaim'
              hostNetwork: false
              hostIPC: false
              hostPID: false
              runAsUser:
                # Require the container to run without root privileges.
                rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
              seLinux:
                # This policy assumes the nodes are using AppArmor rather than SELinux.
                rule: 'RunAsAny'
              supplementalGroups:
                rule: 'MustRunAs'
                ranges:
                # Forbid adding the root group.
                - min: 1
                  max: 65535
              fsGroup:
                rule: 'MustRunAs'
                ranges:
                # Forbid adding the root group.
                - min: 1
                  max: 65535
              readOnlyRootFilesystem: false

          This policy prevents pods from running as privileged or escalating privileges. It also restricts the types of volumes that can be mounted and the root supplemental groups that can be added.
          Another, albeit similar, approach is to start with policy that locks everything down and incrementally add exceptions for applications that need looser restrictions such as logging agents which need the ability to mount a host path.

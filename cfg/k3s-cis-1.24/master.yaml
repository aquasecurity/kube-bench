          By default, the K3s kube-apiserver complies with this test. Changes to these values may cause regression, therefore ensure that all apiserver clients support the new TLS configuration before applying it in production deployments.
          If a custom TLS configuration is required, consider also creating a custom version of this rule that aligns with your requirements.
          If this check fails, remove any custom configuration around `tls-cipher-suites` or update the /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml file to match the default by adding the following:

          Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be
          implemented in place of client certificates.

          Review the audit policy provided for the cluster and ensure that it covers
          at least the following areas,
          - Access to Secrets managed by the cluster. Care should be taken to only
            log Metadata for requests to Secrets, ConfigMaps, and TokenReviews, in
            order to avoid risk of logging sensitive data.
          - Modification of Pod and Deployment objects.
          - Use of `pods/exec`, `pods/portforward`, `pods/proxy` and `services/proxy`.
          For most requests, minimally logging at the Metadata level is recommended
          (the most basic level of logging).

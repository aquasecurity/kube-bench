          Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
          if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
          Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
          clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
          kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

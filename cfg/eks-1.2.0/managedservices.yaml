          To utilize AWS ECR for Image scanning please follow the steps below:

          To create a repository configured for scan on push (AWS CLI):
          aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE

          To edit the settings of an existing repository (AWS CLI):
          aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE

          Use the following steps to start a manual image scan using the AWS Management Console.
              Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.
              From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.
              In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.
              On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to scan.
              On the Images page, select the image to scan and then choose Scan.

          Before you use IAM to manage access to Amazon ECR, you should understand what IAM features
          are available to use with Amazon ECR. To get a high-level view of how Amazon ECR and other
          AWS services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.

          You can use your Amazon ECR images with Amazon EKS, but you need to satisfy the following prerequisites.

          The Amazon EKS worker node IAM role (NodeInstanceRole) that you use with your worker nodes must possess
          the following IAM policy permissions for Amazon ECR.

          This process can only be performed during Cluster Creation.

          Enable 'Secrets Encryption' during Amazon EKS cluster creation as described
          in the links within the 'References' section.

          Create a Fargate profile for your cluster Before you can schedule pods running on Fargate
          in your cluster, you must define a Fargate profile that specifies which pods should use
          Fargate when they are launched. For more information, see AWS Fargate profile.

          Note: If you created your cluster with eksctl using the --fargate option, then a Fargate profile has
          already been created for your cluster with selectors for all pods in the kube-system
          and default namespaces. Use the following procedure to create Fargate profiles for
          any other namespaces you would like to use with Fargate.

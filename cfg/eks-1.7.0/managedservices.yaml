          To utilize AWS ECR for Image scanning please follow the steps below:

          To create a repository configured for scan on push (AWS CLI):
          aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE

          To edit the settings of an existing repository (AWS CLI):
          aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE

          Use the following steps to start a manual image scan using the AWS Management Console.

          1.  Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.
          2.  From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.
          3.  In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.
          4.  On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to scan.
          5.  On the Images page, select the image to scan and then choose Scan.

        type: "manual"
        remediation: |
          To minimize AWS ECR container registries to only those approved, you can follow these steps:

          1.  Define your approval criteria: Determine the criteria that containers must meet to
              be considered approved. This can include factors such as security, compliance,
              compatibility, and other requirements.
          2.  Identify all existing ECR registries: Identify all ECR registries that are currently
              being used in your organization.
          3.  Evaluate ECR registries against approval criteria: Evaluate each ECR registry
              against your approval criteria to determine whether it should be approved or not.
              This can be done by reviewing the registry settings and configuration, as well as
              conducting security assessments and vulnerability scans.
          4.  Establish policies and procedures: Establish policies and procedures that outline
              how ECR registries will be approved, maintained, and monitored. This should
              include guidelines for developers to follow when selecting a registry for their
              container images.
          5.  Implement access controls: Implement access controls to ensure that only
              approved ECR registries are used to store and distribute container images. This
              can be done by setting up IAM policies and roles that restrict access to
              unapproved registries or create a whitelist of approved registries.
          6.  Monitor and review: Continuously monitor and review the use of ECR registries
              to ensure that they continue to meet your approval criteria. This can include

        remediation: |
          With IAM roles for service accounts on Amazon EKS clusters, you can associate an
          IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. This service account can then provide
          AWS permissions to the containers in any pod that uses that service account. With this
          feature, you no longer need to provide extended permissions to the worker node IAM
          role so that pods on that node can call AWS APIs.
          Applications must sign their AWS API requests with AWS credentials. This feature
          provides a strategy for managing credentials for your applications, similar to the way
          that Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide credentials to Amazon EC2 instances.
          Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or using the
          Amazon EC2 instance’s role, you can associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service
          account. The applications in the pod’s containers can then use an AWS SDK or the
          AWS CLI to make API requests to authorized AWS services.

          The IAM roles for service accounts feature provides the following benefits:

          - Least privilege - By using the IAM roles for service accounts feature, you no
            longer need to provide extended permissions to the worker node IAM role so that
            pods on that node can call AWS APIs. You can scope IAM permissions to a
            service account, and only pods that use that service account have access to
            those permissions. This feature also eliminates the need for third-party solutions
            such as kiam or kube2iam.
          - Credential isolation - A container can only retrieve credentials for the IAM role
            that is associated with the service account to which it belongs. A container never
            has access to credentials that are intended for another container that belongs to
            another pod.
          - Audit-ability - Access and event logging is available through CloudTrail to help
            ensure retrospective auditing.

          By enabling private endpoint access to the Kubernetes API server, all communication
          between your nodes and the API server stays within your VPC. You can also limit the IP
          addresses that can access your API server from the internet, or completely disable
          internet access to the API server.
          With this in mind, you can update your cluster accordingly using the AWS CLI to ensure
          that Private Endpoint Access is enabled.
          If you choose to also enable Public Endpoint Access then you should also configure a
          list of allowable CIDR blocks, resulting in restricted access from the internet. If you
          specify no CIDR blocks, then the public API server endpoint is able to receive and
          process requests from all IP addresses by defaulting to ['0.0.0.0/0'].
          For example, the following command would enable private access to the Kubernetes
          API as well as limited public access over the internet from a single IP address (noting
          the /32 CIDR suffix):
          aws eks update-cluster-config --region $AWS_REGION --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resources-vpc-config endpointPrivateAccess=true,endpointPrivateAccess=true,publicAccessCidrs="203.0.113.5/32"

          Note: The CIDR blocks specified cannot include reserved addresses.
          There is a maximum number of CIDR blocks that you can specify. For more information,
          see the EKS Service Quotas link in the references section.
          For more detailed information, see the EKS Cluster Endpoint documentation link in the
          references section.

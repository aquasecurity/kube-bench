          Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
          if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
          Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
          clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
          kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

        type: "manual"
        remediation: |
          Seccomp is an alpha feature currently. By default, all alpha features are disabled. So, you
          would need to enable alpha features in the apiserver by passing "--feature-
          gates=AllAlpha=true" argument.
          Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS
          parameter to "--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          KUBE_API_ARGS="--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          Based on your system, restart the kube-apiserver service. For example:
          systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service
          Use annotations to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An
          example is as below:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Pod
          metadata:
            name: trustworthy-pod

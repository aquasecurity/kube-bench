4.2.6 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set protectKernelDefaults: true.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--protect-kernel-defaults=true
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

4.2.9 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set eventRecordQPS: to an appropriate level.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

4.2.10 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set tlsCertFile to the location
of the certificate file to use to identify this Kubelet, and tlsPrivateKeyFile
to the location of the corresponding private key file.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameters in KUBELET_CERTIFICATE_ARGS variable.
--tls-cert-file=<path/to/tls-certificate-file>
--tls-private-key-file=<path/to/tls-key-file>
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

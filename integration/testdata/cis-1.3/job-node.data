== Remediations ==
2.1.1 Edit the kubelet service file /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
on each worker node and set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--allow-privileged=false

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

2.1.5 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set readOnlyPort to 0 .
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--read-only-port=0
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

2.1.7 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set protectKernelDefaults: true .
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.

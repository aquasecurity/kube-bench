V-242390 If using a Kubelet config file, edit $kubeletconf to set authentication: anonymous: enabled to
false.
If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file
$kubeletsvc on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--anonymous-auth=false

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

V-242400 Edit any manifest files or $kubeletconf that contain the feature-gates
setting with AllAlpha set to "true".

V-242387 If using a Kubelet config file, edit /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml to set readOnlyPort to 0.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--read-only-port=0
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

V-242397 Edit /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml on each node to to remove the staticPodPath
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example,
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

V-242415 Run the following command:
kubectl get all -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@..secretKeyRef)]} {.kind} {.metadata.name} {"\n"}{end}' -A
If any of the values returned reference environment variables
rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than
from environment variables.

V-242434 If using a Kubelet config file, edit /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml to set protectKernelDefaults: true.

V-242393 To stop the sshd service, run the command: systemctl stop sshd

V-242394 To disable the sshd service, run the command:
  chkconfig sshd off

V-242395 Run the command: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l k8s-app=kubernetes-dashboard
If any resources are returned, this is a finding.
Fix Text: Delete the Kubernetes dashboard deployment with the following command:
  kubectl delete deployment kubernetes-dashboard --namespace=kube-system

V-242414 For any of the pods that are using ports below 1024,
reconfigure the pod to use a service to map a host non-privileged
port to the pod port or reconfigure the image to use non-privileged ports.

V-242442 To view all pods and the images used to create the pods, from the Master node, run the following command:
 kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{..image}" | \
 tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' | \
 sort | \
 uniq -c
 Review the images used for pods running within Kubernetes.
 Remove any old pods that are using older images.

V-242396 If any Worker nodes are not using kubectl version 1.12.9 or newer, this is a finding.
Upgrade the Master and Worker nodes to the latest version of kubectl.

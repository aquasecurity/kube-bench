== Remediations ==
2.1.4 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set readOnlyPort to 0 .
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--read-only-port=0
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

2.1.6 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set protectKernelDefaults: true .
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--protect-kernel-defaults=true
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

2.1.9 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set eventRecordQPS: 0 .
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
--event-qps=0
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

2.1.10 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set tlsCertFile to the location of the certificate
file to use to identify this Kubelet, and tlsPrivateKeyFile to the location of the
corresponding private key file.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each worker node and
set the below parameters in KUBELET_CERTIFICATE_ARGS variable.
--tls-cert-file=<path/to/tls-certificate-file>
file=<path/to/tls-key-file>
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

2.1.13 Edit the kubelet service file /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
on each worker node and set the below parameter in KUBELET_CERTIFICATE_ARGS variable.
--feature-gates=RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

2.2.5 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
node. For example,
chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/proxy.conf

2.2.6 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
node. For example,
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/proxy.conf
